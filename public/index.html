      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <p class="box">The framework that I chose to create the page was React. First I installed the appropriate version of nodejs for my computer from "www.nodejs.org".
        Next I created a folder in my drive to store my react projects. Then I opened powershell and changed my directory to the folder I created and executed the command "npx create-react-app lab10c"
        to install react and create my project. After that I used Visual Studio Code to start creating my website. Once I finished I entered my project's directory and ran the 
        "npm start" command.
