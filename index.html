First I installed the appropriate version of nodejs for my computer from "www.nodejs.org". Next I created a folder in my drive to store my react projects. Then I opened powershell and changed my directory to the folder I created and executed the command "npx create-react-app lab10c" to install react and create my project. After that I used Visual Studio Code to start creating my website. Once I finished I entered my project's directory and ran the "npm start" command to compile and view my website.</p><h2 style="margin:20px">Hosting The Website</h2><p class="box">I chose to host my website using github. To do this I first logged in to my account and created a repository. Then I converted my react project to a git repository using the commands "git init", "git add ." and "git commit -m 'initial commit'". After that I added it as the remote repositoy and pushed the code to it using "git remote add origin (link to repository)" and "git push origin master". Next I installed the "gh-pages" package using "npm install --save gh-pages". Then I modified the package.json file by adding the "homepage", "predeploy" and "deploy" statements. Finally I deployed the website using "npm run deploy".</p><h2 style="margin:20px">Difficulties</h2><p class="box">I had difficulties with deciding what to host my page with and finding out how to do it. I solved these problems by searching google for the best ways to host a website and how to host websites using github.</p></div></body></html>
